### Remove automatic K8s API wide-open security group rule cleanup

The automatic cleanup task that removed the `0.0.0.0/0` inbound rule for port `6443` (Kubernetes API) from the management security group has been removed from the provisioning playbook.

**Manual step required:** If your environment had this wide-open rule applied as a hotfix, you must manually remove it during the upgrade to this version. Run the following commands, replacing `<sg_name>` with your management security group name:

```bash
# Find the rule ID
openstack security group rule list <sg_name> --protocol tcp --ingress --remote-ip 0.0.0.0/0

# Delete it
openstack security group rule delete <rule_id>
```

### Remove legacy SSH cleanup task

The one-time cleanup task that removed the legacy SSH `0.0.0.0/0` rule from `management-sg` has been removed from the provisioning playbook. All environments have already been updated to remove this rule in previous releases, so no manual action is required.
